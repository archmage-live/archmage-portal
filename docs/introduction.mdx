# Introduction

Archmage is a simple-to-use yet full-featured Web3 non-custodial wallet.
It is currently available as a browser extension,
and the mobile app for both Android and iOS devices is coming in the near future.
It comes with built-in support for Ethereum mainnet, Ethereum L2, EVM compatible chains,
and Cosmos AppChains. The powerful and robust local non-custodial key and data storage
framework brings unparalleled asset management capability and decentralized identity
user experience. And it also provides a rich extensibility model lets plugin authors
plug directly into the Archmage Dashboard UI and contribute functionality through
the Plugin APIs.
